This is a [React](https://react.dev/) project bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Project documentation available at
[MinhasHoras.docs](https://minhashoras.readthedocs.io).

MinhasHoras.app is a web application built using TypeScript and React, designed to help track the time spent on clients,
projects, and tasks. This web client aims to provide a simple solution for managing time where
users can register clients, projects, tasks, log the time spent on each activity, and generate reports on the total
time spent per client, project, task, etc.

## Disclaimer

This project serves as a laboratory for the implementation of best practices in software project design and development.
This project focuses particularly on the development of web application using TypeScript and React.
Our primary objective is to create a well-structured and maintainable codebase, ensuring the use of effective coding
standards and techniques.

Please note that this application is a **work in progress**, and is not yet a finished product.
It is continuously being refined and improved, with a strong emphasis on implementing and experimenting with best
practices in the software development lifecycle.

## Project Goals

1. Demonstrate the application of best practices in project management and software development.
2. Create a scalable, maintainable, and efficient codebase using TypeScript and React.

## Current Status

This project is currently under active development. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcomed and
appreciated.
As we work on refining and expanding the application, we will continue to apply and explore best practices to ensure the
highest quality of code and functionality.

As a reminder, this application is not a finished product, and its primary purpose is to serve as a learning and
experimentation platform for developers interested in honing their skills and understanding of best practices in
software
development, particularly in the context of TypeScript and React development.

Thank you for visiting our project repository. We hope you find it useful and informative, and we welcome your
contributions to our ongoing journey towards.
